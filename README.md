# Background

This repo is the short version of SUSE DevSecOps Workshop:
https://github.com/dsohk/rancher-devsecops-workshop

The purpose of short version is to simplify the setup procedure and make it easier to deliver as a external activity such as a customer demo. 

Compare to the original version, the change can be summarized:

- Shrink the lab size:
From 7 VM to 4 VM, and from 5 Clusters to 4 Clusters. 
The layout of lab scenario is updated accordingly and shown in the picture in the top.
Specifically, removed the standalone cluster for Harbor and placed Harbor into the devsecops cluster.
- Automate the manual config steps in Jenkins for:
Add credentials for GitHub and SonarQube.
Add the Env Setting for Harbor.
Add the Plugin settings for SonarQube.
- Remove the steps to manually download the cluster config file of devsecops into Harbor VM. Itâ€™s automated into part of devsecops VM setting.
- Combine the installation steps of Longhorn, Harbor, SonarQube, Anchore and Jenkins.  

There are still some steps which have not been further scripted due to different considerations:

- It's infeasible to automate the Rancher UI operation for creating/importing RKE2 Cluster.
Till Rancher 2.6.3, creating/importing RKE cluster via Rancher API/CLI is not supported.
- It's infeasible to script the Jenkins setting for plugin Anchore.
Anchore setting is bound to use web GUI and cannot be automated by script or code.
- As workshop perpose including explaining the CICD process, the GitHub website operation (fork a project, setup token, edit the code) remain as GUI operation for presentation at demo.
- The Jenkins job (Pipeline) operation (create / trigger build) is possible to script by Jenkins API.
It remains as GUI operation for presentation at demo.
